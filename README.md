# Hello and Welcome to My Goals App!

### This App was created using React, a javascript framework! I learned alot during my time building this project from using state to change a component to a whole different component. 

### I also learned how to take in user input by creating and rendering forms, then rendering the data into the UI. 

### React seemed intimdating at first but when I learned that all React was just broken down small pieces of reusable code called components. It really made it easier for me to understand how everything starts to work together

### Feel free to check out my other projects as I am always creating and finding ways to improve!
